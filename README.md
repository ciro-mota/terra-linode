This project aims to provision instances on Linode with the help of Terraform.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution!

Linode charges you for the use of VMs [even if they are in a powered off state](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/platform/billing/#will-i-be-billed-for-powered-off-or-unused-services) and this can cause a huge cost issue for some people. So you can never forget to `destroy` your instances after some testing.

## üìå Before executing:

1. It is necessary to get credentials for Terraform execution.

- Create a [Linode Personal Access Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/api/guides/manage-api-tokens/).

2. Add two variables to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash 
export TF_VAR_LINODE_CLI_TOKEN=<your-personal-access-token>
export TF_VAR_public_key_path=$(cat /home/your-username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
```

## üíª Usage

- Clone this repo.
- By default an instance with **Debian 12** with `g6-nanode-1` will be provisioned, if you want another OS or machine, modify the `variables.tf` files if you wish.
- Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan -out= name-of-the-plan` and `terraform apply`. At the end, `terraform destroy`

## üîß Stackscripts

You can also apply post-installation scripts to your Linode instance through Stackscripts. This project counts as example scripts for `nginx` provisioning.

You can create your own script and send it into the instance via the `bash <(curl -sk URL)` line in the `resources.tf` file.

To work with these settings, uncomment line `10` in the `instance.tf` file.

## üíæ Remote state

Linode clearly does not have an official backend for remote state so adaptation is necessary to work with this feature.

- You will need to have `linode-cli` and the `boto3` library installed.
- In the `resources.tf` file, uncomment lines `45` to `52`.
- On line `49` change the `cluster` and bucket name to the ones you created.

Terraform will, after provisioning the requested resources, run `linode-cli` to send the `terraform.tfstate` file to a previously created bucket.
