This project aims to provision instances on Linode with the help of Terraform.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution!

Linode charges you for the use of VMs [even if they are in a powered off state](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/platform/billing/#will-i-be-billed-for-powered-off-or-unused-services) and this can cause a huge cost issue for some people. So you can never forget to `destroy` your instances after some testing.

## üìå Before executing:

1. It is necessary to get credentials for Terraform execution.

- Create a [Linode Personal Access Token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/api/guides/manage-api-tokens/).

2. Add two variables to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash 
export TF_VAR_LINODE_CLI_TOKEN=<your-personal-access-token>
export TF_VAR_public_key_path=$(cat /home/your-username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
```

## üíª Usage

- Clone this repo.
- By default an instance with **Debian 12** with `g6-nanode-1` will be provisioned, if you want another OS or machine, modify the `variables.tf` files if you wish.
- Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan -out= name-of-the-plan` and `terraform apply`. At the end, `terraform destroy`

## üîß Stackscripts

You can also apply post-installation scripts to your Linode instance through Stackscripts. This project counts as example scripts for `nginx` provisioning.

You can create your own script and send it into the instance via the `bash <(curl -sk URL)` line in the `resources.tf` file.

To work with these settings, uncomment line `10` in the `instance.tf` file.

## üíæ Remote state

Linode clearly does not have an official backend for remote state so adaptation is necessary to work with this feature. For the two options below, you must manually create a bucket in Object Storage and [create Access Keys](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/access-keys/) for it.

### Option A

Linode Object Storage supports S3-compatible applications, so the `aws cli` is supported for file handling with Linode.

- Install it.
- Run the command `aws configure` for configuration.
- When prompted, enter the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` provided by Linode. The region field can be left blank.
- Activate bucket versioning with the command below:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --endpoint=<your-endpoint-region>.linodeobjects.com --bucket=<your-bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

- In the `resources.tf` file, uncomment lines `45` to `52`.
- On line `49` change the to the **name of your bucket** and the **region** chosen when creating the bucket.

Terraform will, after provisioning the requested resources run `aws-cli` to send the `terraform.tfstate` file to a previously created bucket and maintaining data persistence after `destroy`.

### Option B

You can also use Linode's own tool to handle files in Object Storage. You will need to have `linode-cli` configured and the `boto3` library installed.

- In the `resources.tf` file, uncomment lines `54` to `61`.
- On line `58` change the `cluster` parameters to the **name of your bucket** and the **region** chosen when creating the bucket.

Terraform will, after provisioning the requested resources, run `linode-cli` to send the `terraform.tfstate` file to a previously created bucket. This method unfortunately **does not persist the files in the bucket** after `destroy`.
